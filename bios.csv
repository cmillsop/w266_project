The
Chair

directors
,
currently
Jonathan

Director
Independence
.



The
Board
has
determined
that
the
following
directors
are
independent
as
defined
by
Nasdaq
rules
:
Mr
.
Alberg
,
Ms
.
Brewer
,
Ms
.
Gorelick
,
Mr
.
Huttenlocher
,
Ms
.
McGrath
,
Ms
.
Nooyi
,
Mr
.
Rubinstein
,
Mr
.
Ryder
,
Ms
.
Stonesifer
,
and
Mr
.
Weeks
.
In
addition
,
the
Board
determined
that
John
Seely
Brown
,
who
served
as
a
director
through
May
2018
,
was
independent
during
the
time
he
served
as
a
director
.
In
assessing
directors'
independence
,
the
Board
took
into
account
certain
transactions
,
relationships
,
and
arrangements
involving
some
of
the
directors
and
concluded
that
such
transactions
,
relationships
,
and
arrangements
did
not
impair
the
independence
of
the
director
.
For
Ms
.
Brewer
and
Mr
.
Weeks
,
the
Board
considered
payments
in
the

the
ordinary
course
of
business
from
the
Company
to
Starbucks
Corporation
and
Corning
Incorporated
,
respectively
,
or
their
affiliates
.
All
such
payments
were
not
significant
for
any
of
these
companies
.
For
Mr
.
Alberg
,
the
Board
considered
that
Amazon
and
its
executive
officers
have
in
the
past
and
may
in
the
future
invest
in
investment
funds
managed
by
entities
where
Mr
.
Alberg
is
a
managing
director
or
partner
or
in
companies
in
which
those
funds
invest
,
and
that
Amazon
has
in
the
past
and
may
in
the
future
engage
in
transactions
with
companies
in
which
these
funds
have
invested
.
For
Mr
.
Ryder
,
the
Board
considered
that
his
son
-
in
-
law
has
been
employed
with
Amazon
since
2008
in
a
non
-
officer
and
non
-
strategic
position
,
as
disclosed
in

Relationships

Person
Transactions

Qualifications
:
Meryl
Witmer
brings
to
the
Board
her
experience
and
financial
expertise
as
a
manager
of
an

The
Governance
Committee
of
the
Board
of
Directors
has
concluded
that
the
following
directors
are
independent
in
accordance
with
the
director
independence
standards
of
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
pursuant
to
Item
407
(
a
)
of
Regulation
S
-
K
,
and
has
determined
that
none
of
them
has
a
material
relationship
with
the
Corporation
which
would
impair
his
or
her
independence
from
management
or
otherwise
compromise
his
or
her
ability
to
act
as
an
independent
director
:
Stephen
B
.
Burke;
Susan
L
.
Decker;
William
H
.
Gates
III;
David
S
.
Gottesman;
Charlotte
Guyman;
Thomas
S
.
Murphy;
Walter
Scott
,
Jr
.
and
Meryl
B
.
Witmer
.
In
making
its
determination
with
respect
to
Mr
.
Scott
,
the
Governance
Committee
considered
his
role
as
a
director
of
and
the
holder
(
along
with
family
members
and
related
entities
)
of
approximately
8
.
1%
of
the
voting
stock
of
Berkshire
Hathaway
Energy
Company
(“BHE”)
in
which
the
Corporation
owns
90
.
9%
of
the
voting
stock
.
The
Governance
Committee
also
considered
the
agreement
between
the
Corporation
and
Mr
.
Scott
that
requires
Mr
.
Scott
and
his
related
family
interests
,
before
selling
their
BHE
shares
,
to
give
the
Corporation
the
right
of
first
refusal
to
purchase
their
shares
(
if
the
Corporation
is
legally
permitted
to
buy
them
)
or
the
opportunity
to
assign
its
right
to
purchase
to
a
third
party
(
if
it
is
not
legally
permitted
to
buy
them
).
That
same
agreement
also
gives
Mr
.
Scott
and
his
related
family
interests
the
right
to
put
their
shares
to
the
Corporation
(
if
the
Corporation
is
legally
permitted
to
buy
them
)
at
fair
market
value
to
be
determined
by
independent
appraisal
if
the
sellers
do
not
agree
with
the
price
offered
by
the
Corporation
,
and
payable
in
Berkshire
shares
.
The
Governance
Committee
considered
these
relationships
in
light
of
the
attributes
it
believes
need
to
be
possessed
by
independent
-
minded
directors
,
including
personal
financial
substance
and
a
lack
of
economic
dependence
on
the
Corporation
,
as
well
as
business
wisdom
and
ownership
of
Berkshire
shares
.
The
Governance
Committee
concluded
that
Mr
.
Scott
's
relationships
,
rather
than
interfering
with
his
ability
to
be
independent
from
management
,
are
consistent
with
the
business
and
financial
substance
that
have
made
and
continue
to
make
him
an
independent
director
.
Mr
.
Abel
,
a
director
of
and
the
holder
of
approximately
1%
of
the
voting
stock
of
BHE
,
also
has
an
agreement
with
Berkshire
with
terms
similar
to
the
terms
of
the
agreement
with
Mr
.
Scott
.
The
major
difference
between
the
agreement
with
Mr
.
Scott
and
the
agreement
with
Mr
.
Abel
is
that
Mr
.
Abel
can
also
put
his
shares
to
BHE
(“BHE
Put”)
and
BHE
can
call
Mr
.
Abel
's
shares
(“BHE
Call”).
The
purchase
price
under
either
a
BHE
Put
or
BHE
Call
shall
be
payable
in
cash
and
determined
in
the
same
manner
as
the
purchase
price
under
Mr
.
Scott
's
agreement
.
In
making
its
determination
with
respect
to
Mr
.
Gates
,
the
Governance
Committee
considered
that
Mr
.
Gates
and
his
wife
are
trustees
of
the
Bill
&
Melinda
Gates
Foundation
(“Gates
Foundation”)
that
since
2006
has
received
donations
from
Warren
Buffett
of
243
,
328
,
574
Class
B
shares
of
the
Corporation
.
These
shares
were
received
in
connection
with
Mr
.
Buffett
's
pledge
to
donate
Class
B
Stock
to
the
Gates
Foundation
over
the
remainder
of
Mr
.
Buffett
's
life
.
Terms
of
his
pledge
are
described
on
Berkshire
's
website
at
www
.
berkshirehathaway
.
com
under
the
heading
“Letters
from
Warren
E
.
Buffett
Regarding
Pledges
to
Make
Gifts
of
Berkshire
Stock
.”
The
Governance
Committee
considered
these
relationships
in
light
of
the
attributes
it
believes
need
to
be
possessed
by
independent
-
minded
directors
,
including
personal
financial
substance
and
a
lack
of
economic
dependence
on
the
Corporation
,
as
well
as
business
wisdom
and
ownership
of
Berkshire
shares
.
The
Governance
Committee
concluded
that
Mr
.
Gates
'
relationship
to
the
Gates
Foundation
had
no
impact
on
his
independence
and
that
he
continues
to
qualify
as
an
independent
director
.

Director
Independence
-
The
Corporate
Governance
and
Nominating
Committee
conducts
an
annual
review
of
the
independence
of
the
members
of
the
Board
and
its
committees
,
and
reports
its
findings
to
the
full
Board
.
Twelve
of
our
13
directors
are
non
-
employee
directors
(
all
except
Mr
.
Bitzer
).
The
Board
has
adopted
the
NYSE
listing
standards
for
evaluating
director
independence
,
but
has
not
adopted
any
other
categorical
standards
of
materiality
for
independence
purposes
.
When
assessing
director
independence
,
the
Board
considers
the
various
transactions
and
relationships
known
to
the
Board
(
including
those
identified
through
annual
director
questionnaires
)
that
exist
between
the
Company
and
the
entities
with
which
our
directors
or
members
of
their
immediate
families
are
,
or
have
been
,
affiliated
.
For
2018
,
the
Committee
evaluated
certain
transactions
that
arose
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
between
the
Company
and
such
entities
and
which
did
not
exceed
the
thresholds
provided
under
the
NYSE
listing
standards
.
Information
provided
by
the
directors
and
Whirlpool
did
not
indicate
any
relationships
(
e
.
g
.,
commercial
,
industrial
,
banking
,
consulting
,
legal
,
accounting
,
charitable
,
or
familial
)
which
would
impair
the
independence
of
any
of
the
non
-
employee
directors
.
Based
on
the
report
and
recommendation
of
the
Corporate
Governance
and
Nominating
Committee
,
the
Board
has
determined
that
each
of
its
non
-
employee
directors
satisfies
the
independence
standards
set
forth
in
the
listing
standards
of
the
NYSE
.

Director
Independence
-
The
Board
of
Directors
of
the
Company
has
determined
that
all
of
the
directors
,
except
Mr
.
Tilden
,
and
including
each
member
of
the
Audit
Committee
,
Compensation
and
Leadership
Development
Committee
,
and
Governance
and
Nominating
Committee
,
are
independent
under
the
NYSE
listing
standards
and
the
Company
's
independent
director
standards
that
are
set
forth
in
the
Company
's
Corporate
Governance
Guidelines
.
The
Corporate
Governance
Guidelines
are
available
on
the
Company
's
website
at
www
.
alaskaair
.
com
under
About
Alaska/Investor
Relations
.

In
making
its
determination
,
the
Board
considered
the
contributions
made
by
the
Company
to
charitable
organizations
with
which
any
of
its
directors
are
affiliated
.
In
this
regard
,
the
Board
considered
the
value
of
charitable
contributions
made
by
the
Company
to
an
organization
with
which
Ms
.
Bedient
is
affiliated
as
a
member
of
its
advisory
board
.
After
consideration
of
these
matters
and
in
accordance
with
the
Board
's
independent
director
criteria
,
the
Board
affirmatively
determined
that
the
matters
did
not
represent
material
relationships
with
the
Company
because
the
amounts
of
the
contributions
were
immaterial
with
respect
to
the
Company
's
and
the
outside
organization
's
annual
revenues
.
Each
member
of
the
Company
's
Audit
Committee
meets
the
additional
independence
,
financial
literacy
and
experience
requirements
contained
in
the
corporate
governance
listing
standards

DIRECTOR
AND
DIRECTOR
NOMINEE
INDEPENDENCE
:
We
have
adopted
general
standards
for
determination
of
director
independence
that
are
consistent
with
the
NYSE
listing
standards
.
For
a
director
to
be
deemed
independent
,
the
board
of
directors
must
affirmatively
determine
that
the
director
has
no
material
relationship
with
us
or
our
subsidiaries
,
affiliates
or
any
member
of
our
senior
management
or
his
or
her
affiliates
.
Our
board
of
directors
annually
reviews
the
independence
of
its
non
-
employee
directors
and
we
disclose
the
board
's
determination
in
the
proxy
statement
for
each
annual
meeting
of
our
stockholders
.
In
making
this
determination
,
the
board
of
directors
considers
relationships
and
transactions
during
the
past
three
years
between
each
director
or
any
member
of
his
or
her
immediate
family
,
on
the
one
hand
,
and
our
company
,
our
subsidiaries
,
affiliates
and
senior
management
,
on
the
other
hand
.
For
relationships
not
covered
by
certain
bright
-
line
criteria
set
forth
in
the
listing
standards
of
the
NYSE
,
the
determination
of
whether
the
relationship
is
material
and
,
therefore
,
whether
the
director
would
be
independent
,
is
made
by
the
board
of
directors
.
Directors
have
an
affirmative
obligation
to
inform
the
board
of
directors
of
any
material
changes
in
their
circumstances
or
relationships
that
may
impact
their
designation
as
“independent
.”
Additional
independence
requirements
established
by
the
SEC
and
the
NYSE
apply
to
members
of
the
audit
committee
and
compensation
committee
.
The
board
of
directors
undertook
a
review
of
director
independence
and
considered
transactions
and
relationships
between
each
of
the
director
nominees
and
us
(
including
our
subsidiaries
,
affiliates
and
senior
management
).
As
a
result
of
this
review
,
the
board
of
directors
affirmatively
determined
that
none
of
Anderson
,
Ballou
,
Barlow
,
Jensen
,
Minicucci
,
Theriault
,
Tucker
,
or
Turney
has
a
material
relationship
with
us
and
,
therefore
,
each
is
independent
as
defined
by
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
SEC
and
the
listing
standards
of
the
NYSE
.

Independence
of
Directors
-
The
Board
has
determined
that
to
be
considered
independent
,
an
outside
director
may
not
have
a
direct
or
indirect
material
relationship
with
Aimco
or
its
subsidiaries
(
directly
or
as
a
partner
,
stockholder
or
officer
of
an
organization
that
has
a
relationship
with
the
Company
).
A
material
relationship
is
one
that
impairs
or
inhibits
,
or
has
the
potential
to
impair
or
inhibit
,
a
director
's
exercise
of
critical
and
disinterested
judgment
on
behalf
of
Aimco
and
its
stockholders
.
In
determining
whether
a
material
relationship
exists
,
the
Board
considers
all
relevant
facts
and
circumstances
,
including
whether
the
director
or
a
family
member
is
a
current
or
former
employee
of
the
Company
,
family
member
relationships
,
compensation
,
business
relationships
and
payments
,
and
charitable
contributions
between
Aimco
and
an
entity
with
which
a
director
is
affiliated
(
as
an
executive
officer
,
partner
or
substantial
stockholder
).
In
evaluating
Ms
.
Sperling
's
nomination
,
the
Board
considered
that
the
Company
is
presently
engaged
with
Trammell
Crow
Company
,
or
TCC
,
in
connection
with
a
development
,
in
an
arrangement
whereby
TCC
is
providing
services
on
a
fee
basis
.
The
Board
took
into
account
the
fact
that
Ms
.
Sperling
is
an
independent
contractor
with
TCC
and
that
she
is
not
involved
in
the
project
,
that
her
compensation
is
not
tied
to
the
project
,
and
that
the
fee
that
may
be
earned
by
TCC
is
fixed
and
limited
in
nature
,
may
be
paid
over
three
years
,
if
earned
,
and
in
any
one
year
and
in
the
aggregate
is
immaterial
to
both
Aimco
and
TCC
.
The
Board
consults
with
the
Company
's
counsel
to
ensure
that
such
determinations
are
consistent
with
all
relevant
securities
and
other
laws
and
regulations
regarding
the
definition
of
“independent
director
,”
including
but
not
limited
to
those
categorical
standards
set
forth
in
Section
303A
.
02
of
the
listing
standards
of
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
as
in
effect
from
time
to
time
.
Consistent
with
these
considerations
,
the
Board
affirmatively
has
determined
that
Messrs
.
Keltner
,
Martin
,
Miller
,
and
Stein
and
Mses
.
Nelson
,
Sperling
,
and
Tran
are
independent
directors
(
collectively
the
“Independent
Directors”).

DIRECTOR
INDEPENDENCE
-
A
statement
of
standards
that
the
Board
has
adopted
to
assist
it
in
evaluating
the
independence
of
the
Campbell
Board
appears
in
the
Corporate
Governance
Standards
,
which
can
be
found
in
the
corporate
governance
section

.
The
Standards
for
the
Determination
of
Director
Independence
(
the
“Independence
Standards”)
describe
various
types
of
relationships
that
could
potentially
exist
between
a
director
and
Campbell
,
and
define
the
thresholds
at
which
such
relationships
would
be
deemed
material
under
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
(“NYSE”)
Corporate
Governance
Standards
.
The
Board
will
deem
a
director
to
be
independent
if
(
i
)
no
relationship
exists
that
would
disqualify
the
director
under
the
guidelines
set
forth
in
the
Independence
Standards
,
and
(
ii
)
the
Board
has
determined
,
based
on
all
relevant
facts
and
circumstances
,
that
any
other
relationship
between
the
director
and
Campbell
,
not
covered
by
the
Independence
Standards
,
is
not
material
.
In
any
case
in
which
the
Board
makes
the
latter
determination
,
the
relationship
will
be
disclosed
in
the
proxy
statement
,
along
with
the
basis
for
the
Board
's
conclusion
that
it
is
not
material
.
The
Board
has
determined
that
each
director
and
director
nominee
,
other
than
Ms
.
Morrison
,
is
independent
under
the
NYSE
Corporate
Governance
Standards

Standards
:
Each
member

Audit

Compensation
and
Organization

Committees

pursuant

Director
Independence
-
Under
the
listing
standards
of
the
NYSE
,
a
majority
of
the
members
of
the
Board
must
satisfy
the
NYSE
criteria
for
“independence
.”
No
director
qualifies
as
independent
under
the
NYSE
listing
standards
unless
the
Board
affirmatively
determines
that
the
director
has
no
material
relationship
with
the
Company
(
either
directly
or
as
a
partner
,
stockholder
or
officer
of
an
organization
that
has
a
relationship
with
the
Company
).
The
Board
evaluates
the
independence
of
our
directors
annually
and
will
review
the
independence
of
individual
directors
on
an
interim
basis
to
consider
changes
in
employment
,
relationships
and
other
factors
.
The
Board
evaluated
the
nature
of
any
executive
officer
's
or
director
's
personal
investment
interest
in
director
affiliated
entities
(
active
or
passive
),
the
level
of
involvement
by
the
director
or
executive
officer
as
a
partner
in
any
such
director
affiliated
entities
,
any
special
arrangements
or
relationships
between
the
parties
which
would
lead
to
a
personal
benefit
,
any
personal
benefits
derived
as
a
result
of
business
relationships
with
the
Company
,
any
other
personal
benefit
derived
by
any
director
or
executive
officer
as
a
result
of
the
disclosed
relationships
or
any
other
relevant
factors
.
The
Board
has
determined
that
all
of
the
directors
and
director
nominees
,
as
well
as
each
individual
who
served
as
a
director
at
any
time
during
2018
,
other
than
Messrs
.
Berg
,
Rodriguez
and
Thiry
,
are
independent
under
the
NYSE
listing
standards
.
The
Board
considered
Mr
.
Desroches
'
independence
in
view
of
the
services
his
brother
provides
to
the
Company
as
a
medical
director
.
After
consideration
of
relevant
factors
,
the
Board
determined
that
the
Company
's
engagement
of
Mr
.
Desroches'
brother
as
a
medical
director
did
not
present
a
conflict
of
interest
and
did
not
compromise
Mr
.
Desroches'
independence
.
Under
the
NYSE
listing
standards
,
a
director
is
deemed
not
independent
if
the
director
is
or
has
been
employed
within
the
last
three
years
by
the
Company
.
Mr
.
Berg
was
employed

Director
Independence
-
The
Company
's
Corporate
Governance
Principles
provide
that
a
majority
of
the
members
of
the
Board
shall
be
independent
directors
.
New
York
Stock
Exchange
requirements
,
as
well
as
the
Company
's
committee
charters
,
require
that
each
member
of
the
Audit
,
Compensation
and
Nominating
and
Corporate
Governance
Committees
be
independent
.
The
Board
applies
the
definition
of
independence
found
in
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
Listed
Company
Manual
in
determining
which
directors
are
independent
.
When
determining
each
director
's
independence
,
the
Board
also
considered
charitable
contributions
made
by
the
Company
to
organizations
with
which
each
director
is
affiliated
.
Applying
that
definition
,
Messrs
.
Finan
,
Mackay
,
Morikis
,
Thomas
,
Waters
and
Wesley
and
Mses
.
Hackett
and
Kilsby
were
affirmatively
determined
by
the
Board
to
be
independent
.
Due
to
Mr
.
Klein
's
employment
with
the
Company
,
he
is
not
considered
independent
.
None
of
the
non
-
employee
directors
has
any
material
relationship
with
the
Company
other
than
being
a
director
and
stockholder
.
Also
,
none
of
the
non
-
employee
directors
have
participated
in
any
transaction
or
arrangement
that
interferes
with
such
director
's
independence
.

Corporate
Governance
:
Director
Independence
:
The
Board
is
composed
of
a
majority
of
directors
who
satisfy
the
criteria
for
independence
under
the
NASDAQ
corporate
governance
listing
standards
.
In
determining
independence
,
each
year
the
Board
affirmatively
determines
,
among
other
items
,
whether
the
directors
have
no
material
relationship
with
the
Company
or
any
of
its
subsidiaries
pursuant
to
the
NASDAQ
corporate
governance
listing
standards
.
When
assessing
the
“materiality”
of
a
director
's
relationship
with
the
Company
,
if
any
,
the
Board
considers
all
relevant
facts
and
circumstances
,
not
merely
from
the
director
's
standpoint
,
but
from
that
of
the
persons
or
organizations
with
which
the
director
has
an
affiliation
and
the
frequency
or
regularity
of
the
services
,
whether
the
services
are
being
carried
out
at
arm
's
length
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
,
and
whether
the
services
are
being
provided
substantially
on
the
same
terms
to
the
Company
as
those
prevailing
at
the
time
from
unrelated
parties
for
comparable
transactions
.
Material
relationships
can
include
commercial
,
banking
,
industrial
,
consulting
,
legal
,
accounting
,
charitable
and
familial
relationships
.
The
Board
also
considers
any
other
relationship
that
could
interfere
with
the
exercise
of
independence
or
judgment
in
carrying
out
the
duties
of
a
director
.
Applying
these
independence
standards
,
the
Board
has
determined
that
Douglas
G
.
Duncan
,
Francesca
M
.
Edwardson
,
Sharilyn
S
.
Gasaway
,
Gary
C
.
George
,
Coleman
H
.
Peterson
,
and
James
L
.
Robo
are
all
independent
directors
.
After
due
consideration
,
the
Board
has
determined
that
none
of
these
nonemployee
directors
have
a
material
relationship
with
the
Company
or
any
of
its
subsidiaries
(
either
directly
or
indirectly
as
a
partner
,
stockholder
or
officer
of
any
organization
that
has
a
relationship
with
the
Company
or
any
of
its
subsidiaries
)
and
that
they
all
meet
the
criteria
for
independence
under
the
NASDAQ
corporate
governance
listing
standards
.
Risk
Management
and
Oversight
:
As
previously
described
in
their
biographies
,
current
members
of
our
Board
represent
diverse
backgrounds
of
business
and
academic
experience
.
The
Board
,
as
a
whole
,
performs
the
risk
oversight
of
the
Company
and
does
not
assign
the
task
or
responsibility
to
any
one
member
or
a
committee
.
Therefore
,
the
Board
believes
that
the
members
each
possess
unique
yet
complementary
experiences
and
backgrounds
that
create
diverse
points
of
view
,
opinions
,
personalities
and
management
styles
that
allow
for
the
proper
risk
management
and
oversight
of
the
Company
.
Independent
Lead
Director
-
The
Board
has
established
the
position
of
Independent
Lead
Director
,
to
which
James
L
.
Robo
was
appointed
.
The
Independent
Lead
Director
directs
the
executive
sessions
of
independent
directors
at
the
Board
meetings
at
which
the
Chairman
is
not
present
and
has
authority
to
call
meetings
of
independent
directors
.
The
Independent
Lead
Director
facilitates
communication
between
the
Chairman
,
the
CEO
and
the
independent
directors
,
as
appropriate
,
and
performs
such
other
functions
as
the
Board
directs
.
Independent
Director
Meetings
-
Independent
directors
generally
meet
in
executive
session
as
part
of
each
regularly
scheduled
Board
meeting
,
with
discussion
led
by
the
Independent
Lead
Director
.

Independence
-
Our
Board
is
composed
of
a
majority
of
directors
who
qualify
as
independent
directors
pursuant
to
the
corporate
governance
standards
for
companies
listed
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
or
NYSE
.
The
Board
evaluates
independence
pursuant
to
NYSE
standards
each
year
by
affirmatively
determining
whether
each
director
has
a
direct
or
indirect
material
relationship
with
the
Company
(
including
its
subsidiaries
)
or
members
of
the
Company
's
management
that
may
interfere
with
such
director
's
ability
to
exercise
independence
from
the
Company
.
When
assessing
the
materiality
of
a
director
's
relationship
with
the
Company
,
the
Board
considers
all
relevant
facts
and
circumstances
,
not
merely
from
the
director
's
standpoint
but
from
that
of
the
persons
or
organizations
with
which
the
director
has
an
affiliation
.
Material
relationships
can
include
commercial
,
industrial
,
banking
,
consulting
,
legal
,
accounting
,
charitable
and
familial
relationships
.
None
of
our
independent
directors
has
any
relationship
with
the
Company
or
its
management
other
than
service
as
a
director
and
on
committees
of
the
Board
,
and
the
Board
has
concluded
that
none
of
the
Company
's
directors
possess
the
objective
relationships
set
forth
in
the
NYSE
listing
standards
that
prevent
independence
.

the
board
considered

reviewed

space

determined
that
these
